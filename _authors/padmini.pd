Hi, I’m Padmini. I spent the first ten years of my life traveling up and down the eastern seaboard with my nomadic parents. We settled in suburban Connecticut. I find myself settling into the city of New Orleans, but it’s probably temporary. I secretly hate change but I know it’s good for me. 

I studied journalism and politics in college. I hope to perfect my ability to drape words over experience in my lifetime, but fat chance.
